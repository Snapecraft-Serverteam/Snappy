Hello!
This is a test tag.
Its name is `testtag`. You can show the tag by simply searching for "test tag". You don't have to enter the exact spelling because I was patient enough to integrate fuzzy searching into this discord bot.

Examples:
```java
this.isJavaCode() ? System.out.println("is definitely Java") : return;
```

**bold**
*italic*
__underlined__

CYA!
